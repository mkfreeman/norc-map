SHORTEST PATHS (REALLY LOWEST COST PATHS)

In order for the path calculations to work, ideally you are running a docker instance of Valhalla (a path calculator). 

You need to have docker installed on your machine.

Once you have that, you run

docker pull ghcr.io/gis-ops/docker-valhalla/valhalla:latest

to get the latest version of Valhalla. Then, we run Valhalla with the Ontario OpenStreetMap data (note the URL in the run command)

docker run -dt --name valhalla_gis-ops -p 8002:8002 -v $PWD/custom_files:/custom_files -e tile_urls=https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/ontario-latest.osm.pbf ghcr.io/gis-ops/docker-valhalla/valhalla:latest

If this is your first run of this command, it will take probably 5 to 10 minutes to pull the data and process it into the custom_files folder. After that, you can run path searches as per the generate_shortest_paths_to_stops.py file.
